# EPAM online course. Basics of OOP

## _Introduction to Java. General Programming_

[Ex1](https://github.com/r-kurian/Epam.JavaIntroduction.OnlineCourse/tree/master/src/Epam/Basic_of_OOP/Part5_Ex1). Create an object of the Text File class using classes of File and Directory. Use the following methods: create, rename, display content to the console, add, delete.

[Ex2](https://github.com/r-kurian/Epam.JavaIntroduction.OnlineCourse/tree/master/src/Epam/Basic_of_OOP/Part5_Ex2).  Create a Payment class with an inner class that can be used to create a purchase of several products.

[Ex3](https://github.com/r-kurian/Epam.JavaIntroduction.OnlineCourse/tree/master/src/Epam/Basic_of_OOP/Part5_Ex3).  Create a Calendar class with an inner class that can be used to store information about weekends and holidays.

[Ex4](https://github.com/r-kurian/Epam.JavaIntroduction.OnlineCourse/tree/master/src/Epam/Basic_of_OOP/Part5_Ex4).  Create a console application "The Dragon's Treasure". A program allows processing information about 100 treasures in a dragons cave. Implement the function of treasure viewing, selection of the most expensive treasure and selection of treasures for a given amount.
The application should meet the following requirements:
> • The application must be object-oriented, not procedural-oriented.
> • Each class should have a meaningful name and informative composition.
> • Inheritance should only be used when it makes sense.
> • Java code convention must be used.
> • Classes should be correctly decomposed into packages.
> • The console menu should be minimalistic.
> • Files can be used to store data.

[Ex5](https://github.com/r-kurian/Epam.JavaIntroduction.OnlineCourse/tree/master/src/Epam/Basic_of_OOP/Part5_Ex5a), variant A. Create an application that composes a flower bouquet (an object that represents a flower arrangement). Flowers and a package are the components of the bouquet.

 In your application you should meet the following requirements:
> • Correctly design and implement the problem domain.
> • Consider using generative design patterns to create objects from a class hierarchy.
> • Implement user input validation, but not client-side.
> • Regular expressions can be used to check the correctness of the transmitted data.
> • The menu for selecting an action by the user can be omitted, use a stub.
> • Special Condition: Overwrite the toString (), equals (), and hashCode () methods where necessary.
